readline (const char *prompt); readline will read a line from the terminal and return it, using
       prompt as a prompt.  If prompt is NULL or the empty string, no
       prompt is issued.  The line returned is allocated with malloc(3);
       the caller must free it when finished.  The line returned has the
       final newline removed, so only the text of the line remains.
readline returns the text of the line read.  A blank line returns
       the empty string.  If EOF is encountered while reading a line,
       and the line is empty, NULL is returned.  If an EOF is read with
       a non-empty line, it is treated as a newline.
